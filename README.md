# Scrabble solver

**[WIP]**

Due to licensing yada yada yada you need to download a `dictionary.txt` on your own, e.g. from there:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redbo/scrabble/master/dictionary.txt
```

`solve.py` is the main file as of now, so `python ./solve.py`.

Oh, and btw, because I decided to use a brand-new match (aka switch) statement, **Python 3.10 is required**.
